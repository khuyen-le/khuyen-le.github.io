title: Design Metadata
description: A tool for designers and innovators to improve their ideas through exploring and remixing existing ideas. By navigating existing ideas and viewing the uncovered NLP-powered semantic associations across important design dimensions (such as stakeholders and contexts), users are able to gauge potential competitors and inspirations. I conducted needfinding interviews, rapid-prototyped our interface through user studies and design iterations, and implemented the frontend (React, Node.js) and backend (MongoDB, Flask).
