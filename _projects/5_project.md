description: An art gallery enhancement created in collaboration with low-visions users, that enhances art with musical cues that give viewers a preview of the emotional timbre of each work before approaching. As they near the painting, patrons will hear a short audio description that describes the most salient visual features of the piece. They can then choose to approach the painting even nearer to hear more about the piece with custom playback control. I conducted needfinding interviews, experiment prototype studies, and user studies with low-vision participants, and implemented the project with Arduino (hardware) and React Native (software). Code available upon request!
