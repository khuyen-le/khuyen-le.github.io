Our team members conducted interviews with participants from diverse cultural backgrounds, which we used to create an explainer in the form of a second-person interactive fiction taking place over 3 generations. We also designed and thoroughly playtested a board game that encourages healing from trauma through interpersonal connection. Both of which can be found on our accompanying [website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs247i/projects/F21/team4/), which was implemented using Node.js and React.
