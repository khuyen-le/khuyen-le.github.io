title: The History Of You
description: A website, interactive explainer and board game that explores intergenerational trauma. Our team members conducted interviews with participants from diverse cultural backgrounds, which we used to create an explainer in the form of a second-person interactive fiction taking place over 3 generations. We also designed and thoroughly playtested a board game that encourages healing from trauma through interpersonal connection. Both of which can be found on our accompanying website, which was implemented using Node.js and React.
